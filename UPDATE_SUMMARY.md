# Math Quiz Generator - Update Summary

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 🎯 Expanded Difficulty System (1-10 levels)
- **Previous**: 5 difficulty levels with basic scaling
- **New**: 10 difficulty levels with intelligent operation selection
  - Levels 1-3: Basic addition & subtraction with smaller numbers
  - Levels 4-5: Multiplication & division automatically included
  - Levels 6-7: Square roots & exponents automatically included  
  - Levels 8-10: Expert level with all operations and maximum complexity

### 🧠 Smart Difficulty Scaling
- **Operation Weighting**: Higher difficulties favor complex operations
  - Addition/Subtraction weight decreases as difficulty increases
  - Multiplication/Division weight increases with difficulty (auto-included at level 4+)
  - Square roots/Exponents weight increases significantly (auto-included at level 6+)
- **Dynamic Number Ranges**: 
  - Levels 1-2: Up to 25-50
  - Levels 3-5: Up to 150-250  
  - Levels 6-7: Up to 600-700
  - Levels 8-10: Up to 1600-2000

### 📐 Mathematical Notation (MathJax Integration)
- **Proper Exponent Display**: `2^4` now displays as 2⁴
- **Square Root Display**: `√16` now displays with proper radical symbol
- **LaTeX Backend**: Backend generates proper LaTeX notation
- **Frontend Rendering**: React component with MathJax for beautiful math display

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Backend Updates**:
  - Extended difficulty validation (1-10)
  - Weighted random operation selection
  - LaTeX formatting for mathematical expressions
  - Improved number range scaling
- **Frontend Updates**:
  - Updated difficulty slider (1-10)
  - Dynamic operation descriptions
  - MathExpression component for proper rendering
  - Auto-inclusion indicators for operations
- **Dependencies**:
